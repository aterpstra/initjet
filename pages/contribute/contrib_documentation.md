## Why spend time writing documentation?

- Good documentation saves more time than it takes to write it. It might be your time, or it might be the time of team members, or even people youâ€™ll never meet. 
- By taking the time to document now, you'll spend less time explaining your code to others in the future.
- The difference between a used library and an unused library often comes down to its documentation.
- Increasing the number of users (by means of documentation), decreases the number of bugs. 
- You (and your teammates) don't have to plough through tons of code every time a new issue / feature is required.
- Good documentation means less slowdown when team-members leave or switch projects.
- Writing documentation can reveal flaws, or overly complex parts of the code.
